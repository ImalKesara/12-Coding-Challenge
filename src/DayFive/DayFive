Mr. Frost walks in holding a sheet of graph paper covered in coordinate points. "We're decorating the office for the winter festival. I've been designing 5-pointed stars to hang from the ceiling, but I need to order the right amount of golden fabric to cover them. Each star is defined by 10 points - 5 outer points (the tips) and 5 inner points (where the edges meet). I need you to calculate the total area so I know how much material to buy."
He hands you a file with coordinates.

Input format: 10 lines, each containing a coordinate pair in format x,y (the points alternate between outer (tip) and inner points as you traverse the star's perimeter)
Output: The area of the star, rounded to 2 decimal places
